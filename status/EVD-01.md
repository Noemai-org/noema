## Session summary
- What changed: migration `0008_evidence_tables.sql` (`evidence_payload`, `evidence_item`, immutability triggers, CHECKs for the eight FactStatus values, the sha256 hash shape, the `read_by` set and a positive freshness window, composite tenant FK, grants), and `evidence/layer/tables_test.go`. The item builder and `EVIDENCE_READ` events are slice 2b and need `AssignStatus` (noema#160).
- Why: REQ-CTX-001 (immutable evidence), INV-10, INV-19, INV-11.
- Risks: a new Postgres table family. Contained by insert-only triggers, no CASCADE, `evidence_rw` as the only writer, tenant on every row.
- Tests added: five, written first and seen failing (relation does not exist). Four mutants caught (item trigger removed, single-column FK, trust may write, extra status); all reverted.
- Decision: `evidence_payload` is written by `evidence_rw` (PERD 38.2 names the writer "Adapter"; adapters run inside the core and Evidence Layer persists their reads). Trust and Outcome read; Execution does not (no card needs it). Reversible.
- Debt entries: none. Conflicts raised: none.

## Pre-work for the next agent
- Exact next step: slice 2b, the item builder using `AssignStatus` and `EVIDENCE_READ` events, after #160 merges; real adapter faults from the Tushe FaultPlans.
- Files to read first: `services/core/migrations/0008_evidence_tables.sql`, `status/EVD-01.md`.
- Do not touch: contracts (no change here).
