# Status · ENV-04 (Integration Lead) · normalised adapter payloads

Updated 2026-11-06. Plan task ENV-04 (owner IL+AG; REQ-ENV-001, REQ-NFR-006). Ruling DEC-2026-11-06 A10 (proposed, docs#117): the Integration Lead owns the stand-in and the Tushe adapters, built on the PERD 34.4 shapes; the Tushe route mapping follows Tushe's final written response (R13, due Wed 11 Nov 2026).

## State

- Slice 1: the read ports `Transactions`, `Ledger`, `Switch`, `Destination` and the `fin.ledger_entry`, `fin.switch_record`, `fin.destination_status` payloads with `Validate` (`services/core/adapters/fin.go`, `fin_test.go`). SYNTHETIC label on the raw switch code is enforced.
- Not built: any client of hosted Tushe (no route is mapped; nothing is inferred from Tushe deck v4, which Noema has not observed); beneficiary and principal-context reads (PERD 34.4 fixes no normalised shape for them); (nothing).

- Slice 2 (same PR, 6 Nov): synthetic_tushe.StandinClient, the stand-in adapter A10 gives this role (Core Engineer 2 confirmed on noema#174 that they are not building it), to the Evidence Layer's expectations; Provenance (wire hash and label) on every read.

## Open points recorded, not decided

1. **Settlement states. Resolved by A31 (DEC-2026-11-06):** REVERSAL_PENDING is non-terminal and never SUCCEEDED, FAILED or REVERSED; a decision on it is wait or escalate. The port keeps it as its own state and `SettlementState.IsTerminal` says so (UNAVAILABLE stays a read result, not a state).
2. **`ReadError.Error()`** still says "case read failed" for every read; harmless, to be generalised in a later slice.

- Purpose: work queue of 5 Nov 15:30: item 5, Tushe adapters per the committed decision records; collect Founder clicks into one numbered click-script.
- Used it for: this slice; R13 (ENV-05 pause lifted) and A10 as the authority; the route mapping left unbuilt because A10 says it follows Tushe's response.
- Evidence: this pull request.
